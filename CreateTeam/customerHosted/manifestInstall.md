## Allow App to be installed within Microsoft Teams

Now that the App has been added to your Microsoft Teams Tenant, your Global policy may need to be adjusted to allow it to be installed by users.

1. From the Microsoft Teams Admin Center https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/ , under _Teams apps_ click _Permission policies_

1. Make sure the _Tenant apps_ policy is set to Allow all apps

> NOTE: You could also specify a list of allowed apps here

## Pin App within Microsoft Teams

> NOTE: You can call the policy whatever you like, it is not required to be called "CreateTeam-ModProd" as seen in the pictures below.

To improve the end user experience it is recommended to pin the App to the main Microsoft Teams list of Apps

1. From the Microsoft Teams Admin Center, under _Teams apps_ click _Setup policies_

1. Click Save

If you created a new Setup policy in step 2 then you will need to assign users to the policy

1. From the Microsoft Teams Admin Center, under _Teams apps_ click _Setup policies_, click on the tick next to the required policy name

1. Click _Manage users_ and add the required users

Further information about managing app setup policies in Microsoft Teams is available:

[Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies)

> NOTE A user can only be assigned to 1 app settings policy so this will remove them from the policy that they are currently assigned too

## User Consent for CreateTeam App Client

When a user first launches the App from within Microsoft Team, they are required to provide consent for their details to be accessed by the App
