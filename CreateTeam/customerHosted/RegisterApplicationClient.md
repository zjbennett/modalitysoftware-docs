## Registering Create Team as an Azure Application (Client)

This document describes the process of registering Create Team as an Azure Application as the first step to deployment.  As part of the registration you will gather the following information for use further along the deployment process.
   * Application ID (This will be the Client ID)

Create Team requires two Azure Applications to be configured, one for the API and one for the client. Here we will be looking at the Client.

### Register Create Team with Azure Active Directory

1. Select the **Azure Active Directory** service from the navigation menu on the top

1. Enter the following application registration details
   * **Name** - Recommend setting this to **Create Team Client**
   * **Supported Account Types** - This needs to be set to **Accounts in any Organizational Directory**
