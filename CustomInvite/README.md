## What is CustomInvite? 

CustomInvite by Modality Systems is an Outlook VSTO add-in that can customise the layout of the Microsoft Teams
and Skype for Business meeting invitation.

The traditional approach to online meeting invitations is that one size fits all customer requirements and meeting
types. This approach worked for audio conference calls where there was only one way that someone could join.
CustomInvite gives you the ability to control messaging given the different audiences and context of the online
meetings.

CustomInvite allows you to:

* Control messaging and deliver a consistent user experience across all Microsoft online meetings
* Have one plugin and template that controls the format of both Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business meetings
* Enable intelligent PSTN dial in number filtering with all numbers directly from Microsoft O365 Phone System
* Enable users to select from multiple templates depending on the audience of the online meeting
* Display third party video bridging information
* Display additional urls â€“ support, surveys and training are often used
* Define your brand and identity
