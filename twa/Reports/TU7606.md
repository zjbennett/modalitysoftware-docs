# Month on Month

User Story: I can find out how the number of users and modality actions has changed month on month, in both tabular and graphical format.

This report tells me:

- Percentage increase/decrease per month for user numbers and modality actions
- The overall amount of change per month across all modalities and users, displaying which elements have increased/decreased the most

View the number and percentage of active users, chat and teams messages, calls and meetings per month, to track change over time and forecast usage models. 

Compare percentage change side-by-side to understand the most significant increase/decrease.
