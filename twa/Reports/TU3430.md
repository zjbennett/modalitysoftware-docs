# Activity by Country and Modality

User Story: I can find out the percentage of active Users per Country for all modalities, individually and in total. 

This report tells me:

- The % of each Countryâ€™s Users who are active per modality
- How the active % differs by Chat Messages, Team Messages, Calls and Meetings

For the UK, 86% of Users were active overall in the last 30 days. Looking at modalities in turn; 65% were active for Calls, 85% for Meetings, 86% for Chat Messages, 63% for Team Messages.
