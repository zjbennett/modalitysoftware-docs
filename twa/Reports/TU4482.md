# Active User Counts

User Story: I can find out the number of users in each country and department who fall into each one of four activity thresholds, per modality.

This report tells me:

- The number of users of chat and teams messages, calls and meetings in Very High, High, Medium or Low thresholds
- How well represented a country's users are at each activity threshold, per modality

See ‘Explain Activity Thresholds’.
