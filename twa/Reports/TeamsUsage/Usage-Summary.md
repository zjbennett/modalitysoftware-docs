# How Date picker works?

The report defaults to the last 6 months, but will show the start date of the range of data in the top right, as you may have less than 6 months data collected

TWA can only go back 28 days for all the data at install.

You can pick one or more months with the "FirstDateOfMonthPicker". Ignore the "day" part. It is a month picker.

A month will include partial data for that momth if the data is partically completed

## Chat - total unique messages. e.g. not chat sessons, but actual messages send and recieved

# Calls is an audio session (voip or PSTN) counting both users, so Rob calls Sam, counts as 2 calls

# Meeting - the sum attendess "Meeting Joined"

# Countries, cities and departments, show if they have had at least 1 type of activitiy during the period. Not including "other"

# Top X is top X by number of activities. Visualising the number of activities, e.g. chats, not the number of users

# notes
