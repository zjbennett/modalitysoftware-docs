# Per Team Profile

User Story: I can find out how engaged and collaborative a team and its members are, and where the team is located. 

This report tells me:

- How users are engaging 
- List and number of members and messages per team
- Level of engagement by team or by location (country, city, department, office)
- Teams messages sent within last 30 days

Overall engagement refers to the percentage of members who have posted messages in a team. 

Review teams messages, new threads, replies, GIFs and reactions, attachments, @mentions over the last 24 weeks. 

View team members by the number of teams messages posted. 
Understand engagement at country, city and department level; drill through to see users and attributes.
