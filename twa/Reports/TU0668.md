# Teams Summary
User Story: I can find all the top-level information I need to understand Teams usage within my organisation.

This report tells me:

- Licensed vs active Users
- How Users are distributed across country, city, department and office
- Total number of chat messages, teams messages, calls joined and meetings joined
- Average daily count of messages, calls and meetings by activity threshold

Understand the mix of activity; filter by department or office to see the differences at a more local level and identify the highest ratios behind the aggregated averages.
