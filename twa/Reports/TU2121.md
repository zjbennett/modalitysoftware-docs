# Avg Use per User per Day by Country

User Story: I can find out the average number of chat and teams messages, calls and meetings per user over the last 14 days. 

This report tells me:

- The average usage level per modality, by country  
- Which is the most used activity type, and how it differs between countries
- How the proportion of one modality to another differs between countries 
- The average daily engagement threshold per modality, across the organisation

Filter by country, then by department and office, to compare daily user averages and understand the different ‘shapes’ of activity within the business.
