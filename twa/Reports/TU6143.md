# Trend Report - Weekly Active Users

User Story: I can find out how weekly usage levels differ by activity type, over time.

This report tells me:

- How many users are collaborating per modality per week
- Whether there's a pattern of engagement for each activity type

Compare graph shapes to look for correlation between user numbers per modality. Filter by all or selected offices, departments, cities and countries to understand which areas' users are driving the most activity.
