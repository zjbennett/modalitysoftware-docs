# Monthly Active Users

User Story: I can find out how engagement differs between modalities on a monthly basis.

This report uses colour-coded activity thresholds to tell me:

- The overall picture of user engagement per modality
- How activity thresholds differ between user groups (e.g. departments)
- Whether engagement is increasing or decreasing over time, and which users are driving the most change

See ‘Explain Activity Thresholds’. 

Monthly data provides an overview of usage to indicate the stability of user activity for chat and Teams messages, calls and meetings.
