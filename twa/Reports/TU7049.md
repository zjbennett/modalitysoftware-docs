# Trend Report - Monthly Active Users

User Story: I can find out how monthly usage levels differ by activity type, over time.

This report tells me:

- How many users are collaborating per modality
- Whether user activity is stable or engagement is falling 

Filter by all or selected countries, cities, departments and offices to understand which areas' users are driving the most activity and change.
