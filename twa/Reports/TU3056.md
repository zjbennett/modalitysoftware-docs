# Daily Active Users

User Story: I can find out how User activity differs between modalities on a daily basis. 

This report uses colour-coded activity thresholds to tell me:

- How activity thresholds differ by day of the week
- How many users are engaging with each modality, and to what degree

See ‘Explain Activity Thresholds’. 

Understand at a granular level how many users are contributing to each threshold for chat messages, teams messages, calls and meetings.
