# Apps

User Story: I can find details of apps in teams, and teams with apps. 	

This report tells me: 

- How many teams use a certain app
- Number of teams by app count (banded 1-30, 31-40, 41-50, >50)
- Details of apps installed per team

View number of teams by app, and the number / percentage of teams by number of apps.

Review a list of apps, with version details and number of teams itâ€™s been installed for.
