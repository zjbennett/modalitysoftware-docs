Trend Report - Activity Counts Daily

User Story: I can find out how many chat and teams messages, calls and meetings there are per day, including over weekends.

This report tells me:

- How much each modality is being used
- Whether there's a pattern of engagement by days of the week for each activity type

Trend lines can be compared with Daily Active Users to understand periods of low or high activity within the user base, and filtered to country, city, department or office for deeper analysis.
