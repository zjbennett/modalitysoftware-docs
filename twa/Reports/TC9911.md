# Guest Distribution

User Story: I can find out how many teams have guests, whether the team is public, private or hidden, and if itâ€™s active or inactive. 

This report tells me:

- The number and percentage of teams, by number of guests
- The percentage of guests in public, private or hidden teams
- The percentage of guests in active vs inactive teams

Filter by team, owner, guest or guest domain.
