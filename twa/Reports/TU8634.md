# Weekly Active Users

User Story: I can find out how engagement differs between modalities on a weekly basis.

This report uses colour-coded activity thresholds to tell me:

- Which users might need help or training
- The effect of seasonality on user numbers and levels of activity
- Who the most engaged users are, and where (Champions)
- How many users are actively engaging with chat messages, teams messages, calls and meetings

See ‘Explain Activity Thresholds’.
