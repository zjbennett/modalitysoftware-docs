# Office Collaboration Activity

User Story: I can find out about the level of collaboration per Office and view averages and running totals for comparison. 

This report tells me

- Weekly channel average of messages, mentions and reactions per User (top 10 offices)
- Running total of messages per week, per office (top 10 offices)
- Number of teams posted in, new threads created, messages and replies

Drill-through provides a list of users and attributes, teams distribution, channel averages and running total of messages for the selected office.
