# Active User Percentages All Bands

User Story: I can find out the percentage split of users by country and department across all modalities, at each one of four activity thresholds.

This report tells me:

- The percentage of users of e.g. chat messages that fall into Very High, High, Medium and Low activity thresholds
- How the split of modalities changes at each activity threshold

See ‘Explain Activity Thresholds’.
