# Team Creation and Status

User Story: I can find out how many new teams have been created over time, by whom and where the owners are located.

This report tells me:

- Teams created to date
- How active those teams are (messages in last 30 days)
- Number of teams per country, city and department
- Team Visibility (public/private/hidden) and archive status

View the year on year increase/decrease in teams created. 

Understand the number of archived teams, whether theyâ€™re public, private or hidden; where owners are located and how many teams each owner is responsible for.
