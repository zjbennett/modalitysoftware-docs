# Trend Report - Per User Activity Monthly

User Story: I can find out the monthly moving average number of chat and teams messages, calls and meetings per user, per month over the last 6 months.

This report tells me:

- The affect of seasonality on average user activity, per modality
- Average user activity per day, by modality
- The mix of user activity, and whether patterns are emerging between and within modalities

Monthly moving averages per user provides an overview of the four core Teams activities over time; compare graph shapes to understand collaboration and usage at country, city, department or office level.
