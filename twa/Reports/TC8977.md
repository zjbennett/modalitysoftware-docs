# Team Stats

User Story: I can find out about team ownership, membership and activity status. 

This report tells me:

- Total teams by number of members
- Team visibility (public/private/hidden) and archive status
- How many owners, members and guests are in each team
- Number of channels in a team
- Average channels, owners, members and guests per team

Review number or percentage of teams by the number of members. 

View key details about each team, and use traffic light activity status to identify inactive teams.
