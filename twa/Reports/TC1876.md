# User Collaboration Activity

User Story: I can find out about collaboration by the number of teams a user has joined, owned and is a member or guest of. 

This report tells me:

- Distribution of teams joined
- Average teams joined per user  
- Per-user team collaboration

Summary information updates dynamically as location filters are applied and shows the minimum, maximum and average number of teams joined and owned. 

View each userâ€™s team presence and drill through to location and attributes.
