# Active User Percentages

User Story: I can find out the percentage of users in each country and department who fall into each one of four activity thresholds, per modality.

This report tells me:

- The percentage of users within a certain activity threshold for each modality (chat and teams messages, calls and meetings)
- How well represented a country or department's users are in each activity threshold

See ‘Explain Activity Thresholds’.
