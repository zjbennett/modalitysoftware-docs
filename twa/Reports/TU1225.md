# Users and Attributes

User Story: I can find out where each user is located, and whether custom attributes have been assigned to them in the active directory

This report tells me 

- Which country, city, department or office each user is located in
- Whether custom attributes have been assigned to a user and, if so, which ones

Filter by user to highlight their location and attributes.
