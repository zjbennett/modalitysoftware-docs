# Guest Details

User Story: I can find guests by name, domain or team and identify the associated owners.

This report tells me:

- Number of guests and guest domains
- How many teams have guests
- How many teams messages guests have sent 
- Who owns teams with guests
- Whether guests have access to files within a team

View owners of teams with guests, number of teams a guest has joined, and number of teams by guest domain. 

Understand the guests and guest domains in a team; whether that team is public or private, and how active it is (archive status, messages and files).
